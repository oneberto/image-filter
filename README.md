# Known bugs and Todos

This project was done in less than 5 hours, so it's normal if you find any bugs. Some of these issues can be fixed with some research.

This is a list of known bugs and things we can improve:

1. The downloaded image always have a 1:1 size (500px x 500px in desktop).
2. We are controlling the intensity of the filter with a second image (with filter) above the original image. That can cause performance issues. We need to confirm if that's the correct way to do that.
3. Mobile users will download smaller images (according to screen size)
4. Fabric.js has some issues with larger images.
